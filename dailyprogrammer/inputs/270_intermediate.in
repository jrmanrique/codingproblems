Theodore was not a violent man. In life, he wielded a calculator and a pen to work, a soft and steady voice at home, and in times of conflict, he mediated it with logic and reason. However, no amount of reason could've stopped the the bar fight at The Drunken Clam. Before he could even utter his fist word, a knife had been drawn and stabbed through his neck.

And as he lay on the ground, the darkness encroaching, a fair maiden appeared with blinding light that cast away whatever shadows had dug themselves into the edges of his vision.

"Theodore," she said, her voice a nectar. "I deem you worthy for the Place of Kings."

Then, the darkness took over.

Theodore awoke in the shadow of a horned giant. The thing stood at over twice his height, its muscle cut like stone, its proportions like the cartoon heroes his son used to watch and in its hand, it held the gleaming blade of a battle-axe.

No breath escaped Theodore. He could only stare, waiting for the giant to decide his fate. The giant laughed and held up a lantern to reveal a thick-bearded face, flush with drunkenness. His horns weren't demonic, rather they were Viking--the helmet of a Viking king.

"I have never seen one as small as you!" the giant roared. "Have you been starved your entire life?"

Theodore moved his mouth but no words came out. The giant wore more hair on his chin than Theodore had on his head. The giant swung his head back and drank some more ale.

"Come! If the Valkyrie deems you worthy, then you are worthy!" He walked off across cold cobblestone to a palace atop a cliff. He turned, his brow crunched. "Hurry little man, the time of war is almost upon us!"

"War?" Theodore managed to push out.

"Yes! The greatest battles upon the greatest lands for the greatest glories!"

"I'm sorry Mr. Sir, but I am a god-fearing man. I don't partake in violence. In fact, my brother once compared me to the likes of Gandhi. Though he said it more like an anorexic Gandhi."

The giant stopped and then crumpled over in laughter. "You are funny, little man! You will surely earn glory, if not with your sword, then with your jests!" And in one massive stride, he took Theodore's arms and pulled the man into the Palace of Kings.

Inside, lanterns hung on every wall, spaced only a few feet apart. A great fire burned in the middle of the room and a roasted boar hung over it. Every man was at least as big, or bigger than the giant Theodore had already met. And they were all at least twice as drunk.

"My brothers!" the giant screamed. "Allow me to introduce to you the new King worthy of Valhalla!"

A hundred mugs of ale rose in the air, splattering froth onto the polished oak floors. "To the Kings!" they cheered.

"What was the title bestowed upon you in life?" the giant asked, his hand clasped around the entirety of Theodore's back.

"Well, my name is Theodore Broxley"--Theodore adjusted his glasses--"I was an accountant for KPMG accounting firm. It's one of the Big Five firms responsible for internal audit, Sarbones Oxley compliance and..." he stopped when he saw that nobody was drinking anymore.

"What is an accountant?" someone asked.

"Well it's a fascinating field. Growing very rapidly in today's job market. So basically you manage money. You make sure the debits and credits--"

The hand on his back squeezed and shut him up. "The man jests!" the giant screamed and raised his mugs.

The entire room burst into laughter and followed the giant's cue. Together, they drank all that was left of their ale.

"Theo... Ted," the giant said. "My name is Harold Bloodtooth. In my life, I have pillaged countless villages and fought in even more battles. I know a warrior when I smell one and you, you will earn glory in the fields of Valhalla!" He pushed a mug of ale into Theodore's hands. "You are Ted, the accountant, the reaper of wealth!"

Theodore raised it with a curt shrug and a small smile. "Thank you for your kind words Mr. Bloodtooth." He put the mug to his mouth, its first drops soaking his lips, and then a horn sounded. Mugs shattered on the floor, spilling a river of booze as every man in the building reached for their weapon.

"What's going on?" Theodore asked.

"The battle is upon us, Ted!" A smile cut across Harold's lips, his battle-axe clutched between his hands. "Draw your weapon and ready yourself for glory!"

Weapon? Theodore checked his pockets, even the one on his button-up but all he found was a single titanium Parker pen.

"I don't think I have one." But before he could even finish his sentence, he was swept away by the horde of Vikings stampeding out the great palace and into the battlefields of Valhalla.

The torrent of rain had come out of nowhere. Harold had called it an omen for a good war, but he also thought the thunder was Odin’s applause so Theodore didn’t quite believe his words. The mud squelched beneath the accountant’s shoes as he tip-toed beside Harold.

“Do not be alarmed, my friend,” Harold said. “The first battle is always one wracked by nerves. But the second your blade pierces flesh and you stand before your shattered enemies, you will feel it.”

“Feel it?” Theodore whimpered. “That sounds awful. Is there a hospital nearby?”

Harold’s laughter boomed louder than the sound of Odin’s applause. “You are an impressive man, Ted. Even at your first battle, you have humor enough to jest! You may be the one to dethrone me and earn my title. Ted, King of Kings!”

Theodore swallowed. Without hospitals, he wouldn’t be able to refill his prescription anti-anxiety medication. He clutched his pen in front of him for comfort. Surely, even in Valhalla, they had use for white-collar skills.

“Ted.” Harold stopped and peeked over a massive boulder. “We have found our first opponents.”

Theodore stood on his tiptoes but couldn’t see.

“I will take the three to the left, you take the one to the right.” Harold grabbed the battle axe from his back.

Theodore raised a finger, stopping the man. “Perhaps an alternative, if we sneak…”

Two massive hands clasped his shoulders. “Ted, I understand your discontent. Why should Harold get the three while me only the one? But trust in your friend. I have been through a million battles. In Valhalla, there is glory enough to share.”

Theodore opened his mouth to refute his supposed friend, but closed it upon seeing Harold’s crescent grin. This man would never believe him. So Theodore just sighed and readied his pen, tears already swelling in his eyes. He had never fought before, much less killed, but he had died before so at least he had experience in that department.

“Ted.” Harold stared into Theodore’s misty eyes. “I must offer you my humblest apologies. I did not know you felt so strongly.”

“Well, this is my first battle.”

“Yes and you wish to make a statement. It was presumptuous of me to assume you scared.”

“Well, I am scared.”

The grin faded from Harold’s lips. He stared, his jaw clenched. “Once again, I underestimate you, Ted. You are not a man who wins glory by conquering your fears, but a man who wins glory despite your fears.” His fingers tightened around his axe and he sheathed it on his back. “Rare is the warrior willing to fight alongside fear itself. Ted, I bequeath you all four of these men! To glory!”

With a single push, Harold sent Theodore flying out of cover. He hit the mud and yelped. The four warriors turned with toothy grins. They wore spiked helms atop their head. Bear fur wrapped around their bodies and their swords glistened beneath the moon.

Theodore pushed himself up and raised his hands, palm out. “Hey fellas. I’m not looking for trouble. I think there’s been a misunderstanding so if you could—“

The closest warrior roared and charged. Theodore squealed, his pen trembling in front of him like it was a cross he could pray to. He closed his eyes and thrust the pen forward. Something squelched. Something cracked. Theodore opened his eyes to see a body in front of him, a pen through its eye.

He looked down at his fallen foe, his knees trembling, lips quivering, and then he felt it—what Harold had been talking about. It was a fire in his chest, one borne of years of being called an anorexic Gandhi by his older brother; being passed off for promotions at KPMG; having a sexless marriage only held together by his children.

He grabbed the pen out of the body and held it high above his head with a high-pitched roar. The other three warriors stared, their swords lowered and the grin wiped from their faces. They too—just like his brother, his wife, and his children—thought him a weak and feeble man. The fire in his chest spread until its flames licked the tips of his fingers.

The bastards looked down at him. But they wouldn’t for long because a corpse could only stand so tall. No. Nobody would ever look down upon Ted, the Reaper of Wealth, ever again.

Odin clapped in the boom of thunder, illuminating the three corpses that lay bloody in front of Ted. The fourth warrior rolled in mud, his hand clutched at his throat in a desperate attempt to stymie the jetting blood.

Ted walked up to him, twirling his pen between his fingers. He looked down and pushed his spectacles up. “Did you really believe that you could take me, even three on one?”

The man tried croaking words, but he only managed the gurgle of blood in his lungs. Ted offered the man a crescent grin, a mirror-image of the one he had once wore to mock Theodore, the accountant. And then Ted plunged his pen through the man’s heart.

“Ted!” Harold walked out from the cover of the boulder. “I knew I smelled a warrior in you.”

Ted turned, nearly squealing with joy. “I feel it, Harold. The fire!”

Harold grabbed at the air. “That is your warrior spirit, my friend.”

And even now, the flames in Ted’s chest burned hotter, brighter. He clutched at his heart. “Like this, I am unstoppable. I can slay any foe, conquer any lands. I am invincible!”

Something thwacked his hand and jabbed his chest. He looked down to see feathers attached to a stick of oak and blood spilling down his shirt. His jaw dropped open and slowly, a numbness replaced his body's pain. The world faded to black and once again, he died.

Ted awoke to the sound of liquid spilling onto wood and drunken cheer. He sat up and found himself back in the Palace of Kings, laying hay mattress in a small enclosed room. The first thing he did was pat his body. A relieved breath escaped him as he pulled his titanium Parker pen from his breast pocket.

And he also no longer had a hole in his chest, which was nice.

He examined the pen, rolling it between his fingers. This was the same pen that had stabbed and killed four Viking warriors. He wondered if that was dream or memory.

Heavy footsteps approached and the door creaked open. Harold Bloodtooth peeked through. “Ted! You’re awake.” He walked in and thrust a mug of ale into Ted’s chest. “Come, the bards are already singing of our battles.”

Ted followed Harold out into the great hall where once again, hundreds of warriors drank, laughed, and sang. They all turned as Ted stepped in.

“The Reaper of Wealth!” Harold yelled and held his arms open as if presenting some grand prize.

The room erupted in cheer and applause. Ted returned them a curt smile before dropping his gaze to his feet. His face burned bright red.

“The bards have sung of your battle all day,” Harold said. “Ted, with a blade no bigger than his own pinky, and an arm like the pines of a pine tree, defeated four Viking warriors. Come, drink with us.”

Ted looked up at the smiling faces of the warriors around him. Never before had anyone asked him to drink with them. He was usually just a tag-along to his wife or brother—the I guess he can come too person. He clutched the mug of ale, brought it to his lips and swung his head back.

“So Ted.” Harold slapped him on the back, stumbling him forward and nearly ejecting his ale back into his mug. “What say you to your brethren kings?”

The room quieted. Only the crackle of flames sounded.

“Well…” Ted said, “I’d like not to die again, if at all possible.”

The warriors around him chuckled. Harold Bloodtooth grinned. Ted nervously laughed beside them, unsure of what was so funny.

It may have been the ale or the fact that for the first time, people seemed to want to be around him, but Ted felt something completely foreign to him—confidence. So he joked. “Um… maybe I’ll try for a promotion. You know, one day become King of Kings.”

Every smile in the room dropped. Once again, a silence settled in. Harold stepped in front of Ted, his footsteps heavy and slow.

“Or not,” Ted squeaked. But even he had trouble hearing those words.

“Your first battle and already you dare challenge me,” Harold said, glaring into Ted’s eyes. “The path to King of Kings is one many warriors have trodden and only a handful have completed. It is a thorny road of pain and blood. Have you resolved yourself to it?”

“Nope. Not at all. King of Kings?”—he forced a laugh out of his quivering lips—“that’s ridiculous. I was only joking. The only throne I rule is regulating Sarbanes-Oxley internal audit compliance practices.”

Harold stared at Ted. Ted stared at his feet. The crowd stared in silence.

At last, a smile broke Harold’s lips and he clasped Ted’s shoulders. “Even in challenge, he is bold enough to jest! Drink and rejoince, Reaper of Wealth. I accept your challenge. The next time the battle horn sounds, you will be fighting to dethrone the King of Kings!”

The roar of drunken cheer echoed throughout the Palace of Kings. The bards broke back out in song, drowning whatever else Ted was trying to say.

The Reaper of Wealth versus the King of Kings. It would be a battle of legends.

Ted crumpled over and retched his ale into the garden in front of the Palace of Kings. The rain had stopped and now a half-moon dangled in the sky like Odin’s mouth mid-laugh. Behind him, the shouts, songs, and fires continued, their noise muffled by the closed door.

“You look pitiful,” a voice came from the darkness.

Ted turned to find a horned warrior with bear fur garments. He recognized the man as the first warrior he had killed.

“My name is Leif, we have met.” He winked the eye that Ted had stabbed.

Just remembering the battlegrounds sent another wave of nausea through Ted’s body and he heaved his empty stomach into the grass.

“So you’ve heard of the way Harold Bloodtooth duels,” Leif said.

Ted nodded. Harold Bloodtooth didn’t believe in victory unless it was an absolute victory, meaning that his opponent should never dare challenge him again. Death was too easy a surrender for this so he prolonged his opponent’s life, pushing them to the limits of human suffering. And then he’d have a drink of ale with them, slap them on the back, and laugh as they told tales of their battle.

“I can’t fight him,” Ted said. “There’s no way that I can. I don’t pillage villages or fight in wars. When I was alive, the most fighting I ever did was over a TV remote.”

Leif’s eyes wandered up as he tried to understand what a TV remote was. At last, he shook his head and said, “Ted, the Valkyries do not make mistakes. Ask yourself, why did she choose you?”

“In my profession, you realize just how easily these infallible systems fail.”

“No.” Leif shook his head. “Ted, I do not believe you understand your importance to Valhalla. You are the first warrior in centuries that may actually unseat the King of Kings.”

“I don’t want to. If you want to, be my guest.”

“I cannot.”

Ted rolled his eyes. “Oh, but you can tell me to. Back in my life, we call this mismanagement of incentives. If you want it so bad, you should do it.”

Leif frowned and stepped forward, his bear fur glistening beneath the moonlight. “You misunderstand, Reaper of Wealth. Harold Bloodtooth would not accept my challenge. Do you ever wonder why Harold is so kind to you?”

Ted pressed his lips together in thought and finally shook his head.

“Harold likes you because you are weak. He must prove his valor as King of Kings but he does not want to risk the title. So if he can find a weakling, he will spin tales of legends and fables to make that man seem strong before crushing him totally and completely.”

The blood drained from Ted’s face. Never before had he considered Harold so cunning. He had thought the giant his friend.

“No,” he said. “That’s not true.”

“Hasn’t he made every effort to bolster your status? Haven’t he misunderstood you at every chance that he had?”

“No!” But even as the word left Ted’s mouth, he knew that it was all true.

“Reaper of Wealth.” Leif found Ted’s eyes and held the stare. “You slew me and that was no fluke. You are a warrior. Decide for yourself what that means.”

With a nod, he left back into the Palace of Kings leaving Ted by himself next to a puddle of vomit. He sighed and dusted himself off. Surely if he explained the confusion, his friend would let him off. They might even share a laugh over the whole affair. He still had time.

His foot just entered the doorway just as the horns of war echoed through the sky.

A circle of warriors surrounded Ted. Apparently, the King of Kings wasn’t just a fancy title. Under Harold’s decree, the war had been replaced by their duel. Every single warrior in Valhalla pushed against each other for a better view of the battleground.

“Reaper of Wealth,” Harold said, an unfamiliar edge to his words. “Do not think that I will hold back simply because we are friends.”

“Harold, I’m telling you, this is all just one giant misunderstanding.”

Just like all the other times Ted had tried clearing up the confusion, Harold seemed not to hear him. The giant took his battle ax and readied it in front of him. “Prepare yourself, Reaper of Wealth, this battle will go down in legend. Draw your weapon.”

Ted shook his head. “I won’t.”

“So you concede?”

Ted’s jaw dropped. Was it really this easy? All he had to do was surrender? He was about to nod and celebrate, but then he caught Harold’s smile. It was the same smug smile his brother wore teasing him, the same smile his wife wielded when talking about him behind his back, the one his co-workers hid, the one his boss suppressed.

Ted didn’t remember much from his previous battle. Most of what he remembered had been twisted by exaggerated songs and re-tellings, but one thing stuck out. When he had killed Leif, seen his enemy fall before him for the first time in his life, he had made a warrior’s promise. Nobody would ever look down upon him again.

He reached into his breast pocket and unsheathed his titanium Parker pen.

The battle ax slammed into the ground, splitting the earth. Ted hopped back just out of reach once again. Unlike the warriors he had faced up until now, Harold was faster, stronger, and his weapon held more reach. There was no opening for Ted to exploit and jam his pen into Harold’s eye, except one, and it was a gamble. It was a simple plan, but one that a battle ax wielder would never think of.

“What’s wrong, Reaper of Wealth?” Harold asked with a grin. Now, Ted’s title was a mockery. “Do you wish to stall until the end of time?”

Ted sucked in air. How would his brother respond? “It’s hard not to when your opponent only ever misses, King of Gorillas.”

Harold’s grin dropped. “Brave words from a man so small.”

The King of Kings charged and swung. The blade whisked the dirt, sending a plume of dust into the air. Ted dodged again, already, the taunts forming in his mouth.

How would his boss respond? “Careful with your insults, you might finally use a word over three syllables.”

The battle ax landed upon a rock and it shattered like glass.

His co-workers? “You’re all lip, no bite.”

The ax sliced the air above Ted, catching the tip of his hair.

His wife? “You never take me out anymore!”

Harold crunched his brow and stared at Ted. Ted was about to apologize for that one, but shut his mouth. He was already in too deep. “And you never take out the trash or do the dishes or spend time with the kids! All you do is work!”

A murmur sounded throughout the crowds. The Reaper of Wealth, in the heat of battle, turned to an absolute lunatic.

“Enough!” Harold plunged his axe blade into the ground and stepped away from it, his arms spread to their length. “Are we here to fight or are we here to talk?”

Ted smiled. This was what he had been waiting for. He whipped his arm forward and threw his pen at Harold. His weapon cut through the air and plunged itself into Harold’s eye. The King of Kings took two steps back and fell to one knee.

“I did it,” Ted exclaimed panting for breath. “I beat the King of Kings.”

“No.” Harold growled and clasped his battle ax. A river of blood flowed down his cheeks and dripped off his chin. He stood back up and took his ax from the ground. “You merely disarmed yourself, Theodore.”

Without the possibility of Ted fighting back, Harold now focused purely on offense. His swings came harder and his strides longer. Even if he swung recklessly, exposing himself to counterattack, Ted had no weapon to counterattack with—which allowed him a new tactic.

His blade hit the ground, just barely missing. Ted stumbled away and before he could regain his balance, Harold left his axe and sent a foot into Ted’s chest. The blow launched Ted off the ground and sliding through dirt. The little man groaned from the ground, his shirt matted with mud.

“Let’s see your words protect you now, Theodore!” Harold plucked his ax out of the dirt and headed toward Ted.

Ted coughed out what little air he could breathe. His chest felt like it was about to implode and no matter how he willed his limbs, they refused to listen. Harold’s shadow approached until it engulfed him completely.

“Which arm, Ted?” Harold asked. “Which do you need the least, you pathetic excuse for a man? You are no warrior.”

Ted’s brain raced for insults to stall Harold, but neither his brother, his co-workers, his boss, nor even his wife had words for this. He swallowed. He had the words. “The Valkyries make no mistakes, Harold.”

Harold leaned into Ted, his blood dripping into Ted’s muddied button-up. “They did when they brought someone so weak to my kingdom.”

“They did not bring me because I was strong, but because I’m a warrior.”

“There are no weak warriors.”

“Yes there is,” Ted growled. “I’m looking at one.”

“You have quite the mouth on you, perhaps that is what I will take first.” Harold swung his fist into Ted’s cheek. “Right after I knock out all your teeth.”

Ted tasted blood. He spat it out and turned back to Harold. His vision came blurred at the edges and his head felt like it had been split in two. But warriors did not fall so easily. “You said so yourself, Harold. I fight despite my fear, but you fight because of it. You’re a coward clinging onto a fancy title, willing to sacrifice his warrior spirit to sit on a pretend throne.”

Two hands clasped around Ted’s neck and squeezed, cutting off his words. Harold’s reddened face filled Ted’s vision. He could see the bloody pen still stuck in Harold’s eyes, the veins bulging from the giant’s neck, and even where the red flush in his cheeks turned violet.

“Your neck is a twig to me. Your body like fine china. Do not lecture me about warrior spirit!” Harold screamed and squeezed. “You are nothing. You are dust. You are a pathetic accountant from KPMG!”

“I’m a warrior,” Ted pushed out and swung his head.

His glasses cracked against Harold’s nose and his forehead hit his pen, plunging it deep into Harold’s skull. A squelch and a crack, just like before, and the King of Kings fell limp.

Ted climbed out from under Harold’s corpse and looked down upon the man. His fingers curled to fists. “I am a warrior!” he screamed to the heavens, to Odin himself.

All around him, the crowd stared in gaped silence. For, Ted was not just a warrior, he was the Reaper of Wealth, the King of Kings—Ted, the Accountant.
